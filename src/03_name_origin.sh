# Only repeated lines next to each other count to they have to be sorted.
# The '-c' option is interesting because is counts the number of items that were duplicated.

sed 's/,/\n/g' |            # If there are multiple origins it's comma separated
sort |                      # Must be sorted for uniq to do it's magic.
uniq -c |                   # Count the number of names with each ethnicity.
sort -nr                    # Now sort from most to least.

# Unsurprisingly for Australia, most of these are from parts of the UK.
